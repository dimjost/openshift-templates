# OpenShift Templates

## What Is This?
This is a repository of openshift templates, exclusively.

## History
Much of this content previously lived in [Labs CI/CD](https://github.com/dimjost/labs-ci-cd). However; this posed challenges for testing and CI. Specifically, the challenge of [openshift-applier](https://github.com/dimjost/openshift-applier) inventories becoming self referential (i.e. the inception problem) introduce significant maintenance burden. To help ease this burden, the templates were removed from [Labs CI/CD](https://github.com/dimjost/labs-ci-cd). The desire was for all templates to live in [Red Hat Community of Practice quickstarts](https://github.com/dimjost/containers-quickstarts) but there has been some disagreement about what content should live in the quickstarts, and thus this report exists as a staging ground. Time will tell if it is a permanent stage or a temporary one.
